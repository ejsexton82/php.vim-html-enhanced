# PHP.vim HTML Enhanced [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ejsexton82/php.vim-html-enhanced.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ejsexton82/php.vim-html-enhanced)
This was originally a mirror of [Vim.org: php.vim (html enhanced)](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=604).

This is a combination of the PHP indent file by Miles Lott with the HTML indent
file by Johannes Zellner, with updates for PSR-2 and HTML5 added by E.J.
Sexton. Useful for editing PHP files with html parts in it which is a typical
job for web designers.
